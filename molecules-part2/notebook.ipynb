For instance, this could be the partial DOS due to oxygen $2p$ orbitals. The total DOS refers to the entire system. In this example, this is the entire CO molecule. Finally, in a crystal rather than an isolated molecule the electronic wavefunction depends on the wavevector $\\vec{k}$. In that case, also the DOS is $\\vec{k}$-dependent and the local DOS is obtained by integrating over $\\text{d}\\vec{k}$."
