A [primitive unit cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_cell) is the smallest building block of a periodic system, i.e., here of a bulk [crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure).

The first [Brillouin zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brillouin_zone) is a uniquely defined primitive cell in reciprocal space.  A computationally important concept is the irreducible Brillouin zone, which is the first Brillouin zone reduced by all symmetry operations in the crystallographic point group. Another concept worth mentioning is the use of high-symmetry lines and points, which are of special interest due to symmetry imposed degeneracies in the electronic band structure. These points have special names, such as the ùùò-point at the origin of the Brillouin zone."
