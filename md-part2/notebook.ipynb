    "\n",
    "It takes a lot of computational effort to perform *ab-initio* MD simulations. The problem is that for a good thermodynamic average, the ensemble needs to be well-sampled. In other words, the *simulation time* needs to be long.  At the same time, each *ab-initio* MD step is computationally expensive, because the electrons are treated fully quantum mechanically within density-functional theory (DFT). In Example 3 of part 1, you saw that this results in a very time-consuming calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully classical MD calculations use [force fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_field_(chemistry)) to evaluate the force acting on each atom instead of DFT. These are interatomic potentials, that are often based on experimental observation and the empirical inclusion of known forces, such as the van-der-Waals force, electrostatic charges, etc. Their quality depends on how well interactions in this system are known. This allows each MD step to become cheap and sufficiently long simulation time becomes feasible. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Machine learning force fields](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Machine_learning_force_field:_Theory) from *ab-initio* MD lets you capture the underlying physics from first principles, where electrons are treated quantum mechanically, and still reach long simulation times relatively cheaply.
